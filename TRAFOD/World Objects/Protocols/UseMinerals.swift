/// This is the protocol for minerals that can be thrown and upon collision create physics bodies. However, they don't have to create a physics body upon collision due to the fact that there are other types of minerals used within the game that don't necessarily alter physics but instead lead to a specific animation, such as the destroyer mineral which destroys loose rocks
