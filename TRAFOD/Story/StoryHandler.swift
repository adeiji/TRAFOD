A shrill fear crawled upon his back.  \"What is this strange mineral they've used.\", he thought to himself.  He was completely paralyzed, all he could control were his thoughts, which he tried to stay in order to think his way through his predicament")

A lone man, nay, a boy, rummaging through the forest of \(StoryFeatures.RathTo), and after a raid of the \(StoryFeatures.Rhidahreuset) at that!  Only one pint have I drunk today, and that's nay enough to hide the truth, from the all-seeing eyes of Borothir the wise!")

        self.content.append("\"Aye shut up John! Use that hole in your face less for talkin' and more for drinkin'. I told you I'm not drunk.\"  \(StoryFeatures.Borothir) paused and his mouth curved into a smile. \"I'm enlightened.\"  Laughter erupted once again")

        self.content.append("\"The woods contain many wonders me boy. You've yet to see what exists beyond the gates and amidst the trees.  Now, after your mum and sister, eh ladie.  A fine quest.  Ya seem a brave child.")

        self.content.append("\"Blasted \(StoryFeatures.Rhidahreuset)!\"  \(StoryFeatures.Borothir) bellowed. \"Preying on the innocent like wild animals.  And they call us Bandits the barbarians! We're up to me, I'd wring the necks of each one of 'em!")
        self.content.append("\"The Bandits! \(StoryFeatures.Dawud) thought he had excitedly only thought these words, but he soon realized he shouted them out loud in surprise.")
        self.content.append("\"Aye laddie, the Bandits.\"  \(StoryFeatures.Borothir) said with a confused look on his face.")
        self.content.append("\"I've been looking for you! I've heard so much about the brave Bandits.  My father says you are the last hope for the Free Kingdoms of Eldron!")
        self.content.append("After \(StoryFeatures.Dawud) spoke these words there was a long, awkward pause.  Almost as if they were all in thought.  And then suddenly, all erupted into a rucous laughter, more intense and genuine than all the other times before.")
        self.content.append("\"The last hope for the Free Kingdoms the boy says!  Aye, perhaps I have had one too many pints.  Ha ha ha ha\" shouted Borothir. \"Tell me boy, your father, did he say this after he reached the bottom of a keg of fine brew!?\"  All erupted into laughter again.  \(StoryFeatures.Dawud) didn't understand.  These were the people his father spoke so highly of, but they seemed to him just a reckless rabble, a rabble that he had no intention of wasting his precious time with.")
        self.content.append("\"Did you see the \(StoryFeatures.Rhidahreuset) come this way?\"  \(StoryFeatures.Dawud) asked in irritance.")
        self.content.append("\"Aye, not more 'en two days ago.\"  The Bandit said in between laughs.")
        self.content.append("\"Where we're they going?\"  The laughter almost ended as quickly as it began.  \(StoryFeatures.Dawud) could tell that his question and hit a nerve he was not aware existed.  Another long silence filled the air.")
        self.content.append("\"The mines.\"  A boy dressed in all black stepped out of the shadows. \"They're on their way to the mines.\"")

        self.content.append("\"Yes ladie.  You've heard of these mines I take it.\"  Dawud nodded his head in agreement. \"Where are these mines?\"")
        self.content.append("\"Deep in the forest, where the sounds of minerals breaking are scarce, and laughter scarcer. None of us has seen the mines.  Only heard stories like your yourself. But we know one thing, those who go, don't ever come back.  That boy there, \(StoryFeatures.Drust) is his name.  His family too was taken to the mines, many cold winters ago.")

        self.content.append("\"My father used to say, \'Only by failing to try can one gurantee failure. Until you've given up, the chance of success still reigns.\'")
        self.content.append("\"A wise man your father.\" \"The wisest.\"")
        self.content.append("You're bravery moves me.  Perhaps I can be of help.  I know these woods better than anyone.")
        self.content.append("The old fat man piped in. \"No Drust, we need you here.  We have young ones to protect.  Your hearts in the right place, but right now, we need your sword.\"")
        self.content.append("\"It's getting late lad. How about we get a pint of fine brew and some roasted Boar and call it a night, and we can speak more of your journey in the mornin'.  Sound good?")
        self.content.append("The days activity had fatigued \(StoryFeatures.Dawud) and he was ready to get some rest.")
